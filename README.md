# HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

We have created a robust digital solution for the hospital management system. This has the potential to replace the old way of how the hospital works.

Our prototype has solutions for the entire hospital machinery from receiptionist, doctor, lab to the medicine shop. This involves all the stakeholders of the hospital system.

This is comfortable and efficient system for both doctor and the patient.

This is the whole flow of our system:-

-> The patient enters the hospital and is greeted by the receiptionist. The receiptionist generates a patient ID for them, which contains fields like name, age, issues, lab assigned, doctor assigned.

-> The receiptionist will assign doctor to the patient. The doctor can see the patient assigned by the receiptionist.

-> There is an interface for the patient, where they can check their details and the lab assigned and the doctor assigned.

-> Now the doctor interface has patient details menu through which he can see the details about the patient

-> The doctor interface also contains options to assign desired labs to the patient where they can get tested. Moreover, the doctor can add the diagonsed issues in the patient profile. On completion of patient treatment, the doctor can remove the assigned patient.

-> Now, coming to the lab, they can see their occupany, the assigned patients, add issue and remove the diagonsed patient.

-> Also the doctor can add the prescription for the patient. Doctor can see the availability of their prescribed medicines and facilities in the hospital inventory and can help the patient accordingly. So this eases the process of getting prescriptions and checking out of the hospital.

-> There is a tab for the inventory too, where the hospital can manage the available inventory, available quantity and max amount. Through this tab, they can add, update and delete a particular entry
